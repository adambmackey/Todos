Capstone Idea 
=============
My idea is to build a to-do list. Once the user logs in they will be taken to a dashboard where their todo list will be displayed. When they click on a todo list it will take them to all the tasks that they have under that topic where they can cross off, delete, or edit their tasks. 

MVPs

- Users can edit tasks
- Users can check off tasks and add them back on
- Users can delete tasks
